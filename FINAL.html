  <h1> THE JUGGLER </h1>          
  <p> This is the final project in which i created for this class. It is an interactive game in which the user controls a clown who needs to try and catch falling balls. There are two difficulties at which the user can play, easy and hard. the easy game mode has less balls falling at once and the speed at which they fall increases at a slower rate compared to the hard game mode. There is an instructions page laying out how to play, but basically you need to move the clowns hands with your left and right arrow keys so that he catches the falling balls. As you catch the balls the score increases and the balls start to fall faster and faster. Once you drop one of the balls it's game over, so do your best to catch as many as possible.</P>
